# Sandbox CDS Services
This repository hosts the default CDS Services configured for the [CDS Hooks Sandbox](http://sandbox.cds-hooks.org) tool. These services are spun up by a Node.js application hosted on Google App Engine.

## Getting Started
Once you clone the repository down to your machine, run the following command to install all necessary dependencies for the project.
```javascript
npm install
```

Once the dependencies are installed locally, you can run the server on localhost.
```javascript
npm start
```

You can test out this app from `http://localhost:3000`. Try hitting the discovery endpoint at `http://localhost:3000/cds-services`.

## Testing and Linting
The JavaScript linter configured for this project is [ESlint](https://eslint.org/), which uses the [Airbnb JavaScript](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript) style guide to correct and standardize JavaScript code. 

To lint:
```javascript
npm run lint
```
This project contains unit tests using the [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/) library. Discovery and CDS Service endpoints are tested by each route and expected behavior. 

To test:
```javascript
npm run test
```

## CDS Services
The following services are configured for this application:

`patient-greeting`: A CDS Service configured for the `patient-view` hook. The service prefetches the Patient resource of the patient in context of the EHR and returns a proper greeting that displays what patient is being seen by the current provider.

To add another default service for the CDS Hooks Sandbox:

1. Add the service definition to the `/discovery/service-definitions.json` file (metadata for the services found at the discovery endpoint)
2. Create the service endpoint route in a new file under the `/services` directory
3. Add a test file to test the service endpoint route under the `/tests` directory
